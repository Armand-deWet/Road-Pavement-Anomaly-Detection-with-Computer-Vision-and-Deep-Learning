## üìò Abstract

The continuous and efficient upkeep of roads is critical to societal and economic activity. Current road damage detection methods are manual, time-consuming, and costly, motivating research into automated techniques. This project investigates the latest YOLO architectures (v10‚Äìv12) for automated road pavement anomaly detection, emphasizing lightweight deployment on embedded hardware. Models were trained and evaluated on the RDD2022 and Roboflow pothole datasets, and the best YOLOv12n model was deployed on a Raspberry Pi 5. Results demonstrate an F1 score of 0.57, showing strong potential for low-cost, scalable road monitoring in developing regions.

## üß† Project Overview

This repository focuses on reproducibility of all experiments performed in the thesis.  
The workflow includes:

1. **Dataset preparation** ‚Äî cleaning and splitting the RDD2022 and Roboflow datasets.  
2. **Initial training** ‚Äî training YOLOv10, YOLOv11, and YOLOv12 models on the cleaned data.  
3. **Transfer & semi-supervised learning** ‚Äî using pseudo-label generation to attempt to enhance performance.  
4. **Deployment** ‚Äî converting the best YOLOv12n model to NCNN format and deploying it on a Raspberry Pi 5.

## üìÇ Dataset Information

- **RDD2022 dataset:** [https://crddc2022.sekilab.global/](https://crddc2022.sekilab.global/)  
- **Roboflow pothole dataset:** [https://universe.roboflow.com/brad-dwyer/pothole-voxrl](https://universe.roboflow.com/brad-dwyer/pothole-voxrl)

### Preprocessing steps:
- Removed all images with empty labels to reduce training time.  
- Converted XML labels to YOLO-compatible `.txt` format.  
- Performed a 70/10/20 train/validation/test split using `train_val_test_split.ipynb`.
